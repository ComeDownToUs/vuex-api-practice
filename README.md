# vue-pokeapi

A simple vuex project connected to a read only api, built with vue-cli it uses all of the default setup options as listed below.

Tests are somewhat limited and currently broken due to the inefficient loading processes I seem to have in place, likely using the wrong trigger events to initiate some changes but the watchers seem slow in general too.


`npm run dev` and `npm run test` are the tested operations




## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
